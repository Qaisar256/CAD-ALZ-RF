# CAD-ALZ-RF
A new approach CAD-ALZ is developed by extracting deep features through ConvMixer layer with blockwise finetune strategy on a very small original dataset. In this study, a blockwise finetuning strategy on the ConvMixer model is employed to detect DL-based features. After-wards, a random forest (RF) is used to classify ALZ disease stages.
